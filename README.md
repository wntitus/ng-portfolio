# PORTFOLIO 2019

This is my most up to date portfolio as of the time of this writing. It's sort of a "port" of an older portfolio, one of my first ones. 
I've taken some of the design from that older portfolio and am now building it out in Angular. It's not something that necessarily needs to be done
with Angular, but I enjoy the Angular ecosystem and practice is always good.

That being said, some of the code is not as clean as I'd like it to be - some of the CSS is very messy and needs to be rewritten, however I've already managed to convert all relevant "px" units to "rem".

## **TODO**
* Further componentize elements
* Mobile responsiveness
* CSS cleanup
